## Structure of the website
The website has been designed to be beautiful on all devices, easy to navigate and user friendly on all types of device. There will be no difference for the user when navigating on different device types and a user will not have a negative experience or miss out on features because they are on a smaller screen or different device. Buttons and links have been designed to be interactive and have hover effects to help the user identify that these are links and improve the experience.
